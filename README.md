# StudySync-AI
An AI-powered study assistant that answers questions from custom materials using RAG + LLMs and exports formatted PDFs.

# StudySync AI 📚🤖
*Your Personal AI Study Assistant*

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Students often struggle to find accurate answers from vast study materials.  
Existing tools don’t let them **upload custom notes** and get reliable answers directly from their own material.

## 💡 Our Solution
We are building an **AI-powered assistant** that:
- Accepts **PDFs / study material** from users
- Uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** + **LLM** to answer questions only from the given notes
- Formats the answers clearly
- Exports results into a neat **PDF answer sheet**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **PyPDF** → extract study material  
- **ChromaDB** → store & retrieve embeddings (Vector DB)  
- **OpenAI API** (or Local LLM like Llama 2)  
- **ReportLab** → generate answer PDFs  
- **Streamlit / Gradio** → simple user interface

## 📈 Feasibility
- Start with small PDFs and API-based LLM  
- Later scale to local models for offline usage  
- Can expand for teachers, students, and corporate training

## 🎯 Status
Prototype under development.  
Demo will allow:
1. Uploading study material
2. Asking questions
3. Getting an auto-generated answer sheet
